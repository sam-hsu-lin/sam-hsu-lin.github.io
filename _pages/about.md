Welcome the front page of my website (work in progress)! 

I am a research assistant at the UCLA Anderson School of Management working with Professors Jennifer Kao, Chris Poliquin, and Melanie Wasserman.

I graduated *cum laude* from the University of California, San Diego with a B.A. in Economics and a B.S. in Applied Mathematics. I have presented [my research](/papers "http://samhsulin.github.io/papers/") at regional and national [conferences](/talks "http://samhsulin.github.io/talks/"). In my work, I am broadly interested in using statistical and experimental tools to study equity and opportunity in our society.

Feel free to connect [on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/samhsulin) or [via email](mailto:sam.lin@anderson.ucla.edu)!
