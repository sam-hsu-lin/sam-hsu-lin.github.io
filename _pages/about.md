Welcome the front page of my website (work in progress)!

I graduated from the University of California, San Diego with a B.A. in Economics and a B.S. in Applied Mathematics. I have presented [my research](/papers "http://sam-hsu-lin.github.io/papers/") at regional and national [conferences](/talks "http://sam-hsu-lin.github.io/talks/"). In my work, I am broadly interested in using statistical and experimental tools to study equity and opportunity in our society.

Feel free to connect on LinkedIn or via email!
